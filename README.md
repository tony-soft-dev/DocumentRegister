<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="/DocumentRegister/Assets/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" width="200" height="100">

DocumentRegister is meant to help automate some administrative tasks and organize a custom folder structure.
A first script is made to see what required files need to be registered and displays that list to prep for saving.
When a file is selected, a form is enabled and a preview of the file that is supported will be displayed.
When completion of the information to save files is completed, an additional script will register that data into an Excel sheet.
